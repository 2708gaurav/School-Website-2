                    The journey of 'Shree-Shree Parva', the school's annual function has been a beautiful, enriching and joyful one that has the elements of education as well as entertainment. The title of the function is an apt one as it celebrates the glory of two great epitomes of Indian tradition and culture. Lord Shree Krishna and Dr. Shrikant Jichkar, the founder of Sāndipani School. Shree-Shree Parva is the unique cultural heritage of Sāndipani school.
